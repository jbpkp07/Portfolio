                        Welcome! I am a software engineer and avid disc golfer. I have been writing automation software
                        and supporting web applications for years, however I have yet to take a deep dive into
                        full-stack web development... until now.

                        This is my <strong>second</strong> webpage, and it was built using the Twitter Bootstrap CSS
                        Framework (v4.3.1). While I have added some custom CSS to adjust some styles, overall, it relies
                        heavily on Bootstrap. This page is fully responsive; Feel free to check out its various
                        presentations across all devices (Desktop / Laptop / Tablet / Phone). As I continue to hone my
                        skills, I am sure this page will progressively become more awesome. Just wait and see!
